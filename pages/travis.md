# What is Travis CI

Travis CI is a continuous integration service used to test software on GitHub. MTT uses this software to build a generic environment and run BAT (Basic Acceptance Tests) on the code. This is meant as a sanity check to make sure that the code works at some level and **not** that it will work on your system.

# CI's Environment
Travis CI spins up a docker container every build (this is specific to our version of Travis CI and not to all containers that Travis  builds).
